# GoTelegramRAT
Control your computer from a Telegram Bot!

This software allow to execute different actions on a user's PC, using and orchestrating everything from Telegram. That is, using Telegram as Command and Control.
The development is done from scratch, it can currently run without problems against the most common antimalware software (Avast, Kaspersky, Eset, McAffee, WinDefender). These are the ones we have tried, but the list is probably longer.

# Implemented modules:
* Welcome message when the connection is received: It consists of a friendly notification that indicates that the connection has been established correctly and may include additional relevant information.
* Screenshot: Screenshot is a feature that allows the remote user to obtain images of what is being displayed on the target device's screen. This functionality can be used for various purposes, such as remote monitoring, activity control or visual information collection.
* Command Execution: Command Execution provides the ability to send instructions and commands directly to the remote system. This allows the remote user to perform specific actions on the target device, such as running programs, configuring parameters or any other task that can be managed through commands.
* Keylogger: Functionality designed to record and store keystrokes made on the target device. This may include passwords, messages, and any other information typed on the keyboard. It is a tool that can be used to gain access to confidential data.
* File Explorer: File Explorer allows the remote user to navigate through the PC file system. This functionality provides detailed access to the device's file structure.
* Reading and downloading files: This functionality allows the remote user to browse and download files from the target system. It can be used to transfer data from the infected device to the Telegram bot.
* Possibility of adding some extra stuff as a modular software
